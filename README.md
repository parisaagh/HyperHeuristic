## üß† Overview

Hyper-heuristics are high-level search methodologies that aim to automate the selection or generation of heuristics for solving optimization problems. This project extends the previously proposed **MOABHH** (Multi-Objective Agent-Based Hyper-Heuristic), a framework that uses agent cooperation and a voting scheme to dynamically allocate computational effort among multiple multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

This paper evaluates MOABHH on **four real-world engineering problems**, incorporating a new MOEA and more suitable quality indicators for complex, practical optimization tasks.
